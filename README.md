Test navigator.storage.persist
==============================

This extension shows the result of running `navigator.storage.persist()` in a Chrome extension that has both the `storage` and `unlimitedStorage` permissions.

It is unclear if something like IndexedDB would risk getting content evicted from it and whether or not it could be relied upon for persistent in-extension storage.
